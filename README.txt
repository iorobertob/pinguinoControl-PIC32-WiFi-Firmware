This Demo App was compiled with 

microchip_solutions_v2013-06-15

Notice that this is not the latest version of these solutions. this is because the latest version did not
include the code examples for the TCPIP Stack.

The code uses Microchip's TCPIP Stack, included in that set of solutions. Hence the code was compiled from within the 
TCPIP - DemoApp folder. 

MPLAB X used for debugging and programming, altogether with PicKit 3. 

The Firmware is based on a TCPIP example for diverse PICs, but optimized for PIC32MX440F256H, that is found in 
Pinguino PIC32 OTG from Olimex.
